#Code should be easy to understand
    All of the principles stem from a single theme:  
**Code should be easy to understand**   
    This is the most important guiding principle you can use when deciding how to write your code. The criterion: compact, intimidating...
    Which criterion is more important? In general, how do you decide which way to code something?  
**Code should be written to minimize the time it would take for someone else to understand it**
