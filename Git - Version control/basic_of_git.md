# What is the version control?
Version control is a system that records changes to a file or set of files over time so that you can recall specific versions later.  
So ideally, we can place any file in the computer on version control.  
- A version control system (VCS) allows you to revert files back to a previous state,   revert the entire project back to a previous state, review changes made over time,  see who last modified something that might be
causing a problem, who introduced an issue and when, and more. 
Use a VCS also mean that if you screw things up or lose files, you can generally recover easily. And sometimes you just want to know
**"Who wrote this crap"**, and having access to that information is worthwhile?

## What is git?
Git is a version control system for tracking changes in computer files and coordinating 
work on those files among multiple people. Git is a **Distributed Version Control System**. 
Git does ot necessarily rely on a central server to store all the versions of a project's files.
Instead, every user "clones" a copy of a repository (a collection of files) and has the full history of the project on their own hard drive.
