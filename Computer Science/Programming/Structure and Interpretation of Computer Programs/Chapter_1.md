#Building Abstractions with Procedures
  We are about to study the idea of a computational process. Computational processes are abstract beings that inhabit computer.
As they evolve, processes manipulate other abstract things call data. The evolution of a process is directed by a pattern of rules
called a program. People create programs to direct processes. In effect, we conjure the spirits of the computer with our spells.
  A computer process, in a correctly working computer, executes programs precisely and accurately. Thus, like the sorcerer' apprentice,
novice programmers must learn to understand and to anticipate the consequences of their conjuring. Even small errors (usually called bugs
or glitches) in programs can have complex and unanticipated consequences.
  Fortunately, learning to program is considerably less dangerous than learning sorcery, because the spirits we deal with are conveniently
in a secure way. Real-world programming, however, requires case, expertise, and wisdom. A small bug in a computer-aided design program,
for example, can lead to the catastrophic collapse of an airplane or a dam or the self-destruction of an industrial robot.
  Master software engineers have the ability to organize programs so that they can be reasonably sure that the resulting processes
will perform the tasks intended. They can visualize the behavior of their systems in advance. They know how to structure program so that
unanticipated problems do not lead to catastrophic consequences, and when problems do arise, they can debug their programs. Well-designed 
computational systems, like well-designed automobiles or nuclear reactors, are designed in a modular manner, so that the parts can be
constructed, replaced, and debugged separately.

##The Elements of Programming
A powerful programming language is more than just a means for instructing a compute to perform tasks. The language also serves a framework
within which we organize our ideas about processes. Thus, when we describe a language, we should pay particular attention to the means that 
the language provides for combining simple ideas to form more complex ideas. Every powerful language has three mechanisms for accomplishing this:
   - primitive expressions, which represent the simplest entities the language is concerned with, 
   - means of combination, by which compound elements are build from simpler ones, and
   - means of abstraction, by which compound elements can be named ans manipulate as units.
In programming, we deal with two kinds of elements: procedures and data. Informally, data is `stuff` that we want to manipulate, and procedures
are descriptions of the rules for manipulating the data. Thus, any powerful programming language should be able to describe primitive data
and primitive procedures and should have methods for combining and abstracting procedures and data.

###Expressions
One kind of primitive expression you might type is a number
